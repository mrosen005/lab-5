For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!


```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

crime_scene_report |> 
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) |> 
  filter(date == ymd("2018-01-15"), 
         type == "murder",
         city == "SQL City"
         )



```
In this step, I am filtering through the crime_scene_report data set based on the clues provided from Detective Wicham to narrow down the data to get the description of the data. 
 
### Finding Witness 1

```{r}
#| label: finding-witness-1

person |> 
  filter(address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr") |> 
  arrange(address_number) |>
  slice_max(order_by = address_number,
            n = 1
            )
  

```
Now that I narrowed the crimes_scene_report dataset down to the correct case and have the description data which provides information regarding where the witnesses live, I am using the person data set to narrow down and find the first witness list.

### Finding Witness 1

```{r}
#| label: finding-witness-2

person |> 
  filter(address_street_name == "Franklin Ave",
         (str_detect(name, "Annabel"
                     )
          )
         )

```
Then, still using the description data set and person data set, I found the second witness. 

### Examining Witness Interviews

```{r}
#| label: examining-witness-interviews

interview |> 
  filter(person_id %in% c(16371, 14887))


```

Now that I have the witnesses ID's, I used this to filter from the interview data set to get their transcripts which provides further clues as to who the murderer is.  

### Using Witness's Clues

```{r}
#| label: using-witness-clues

# I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".

# I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

get_fit_now_member |> 
  filter(membership_status == "gold",
         str_detect(id,
                   "48Z"
                   )
         ) |>
  left_join(get_fit_now_check_in,
             by = c("id" = "membership_id"
                     )
              ) |>
  mutate(check_in_date = ymd(check_in_date)) |>
  filter(check_in_date == ymd("2018-01-09")) |>  
  left_join(person, 
            by = c("person_id" = "id"
                   ) 
         ) |> 
  left_join(drivers_license,
            by = c("license_id" = "id"
                   )
            ) |>
  filter(str_detect(plate_number,
                      "H42W"
                  )
          )
  

  

```

In this step, I used the clues from the witness testimonies to narrow down to the suspected individual. 

### Examining Suspect's Interview

```{r}
#| label: examining-suspect's-interview

interview |> 
  filter(person_id == "67318")
```
In this step, I then checked the suspected individual's interview. From the interview, I gathered that Jeremy Bowers was the hitman. 

### Finding Person Responsible

```{r}
#| label: finding-person-responsible

# I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

drivers_license |> 
  filter(height %in% c("65","66",
                        "67"
                        ),
         hair_color == "red",
         car_make == "Tesla", 
         car_model == "Model S", 
         gender == "female"
         ) |>
  left_join(person,
            by = c("id" = "license_id"
                   )
            )|> 
 left_join(facebook_event_checkin,
            by = c("id.y" = "person_id"
                   )
           ) |> 
  filter(event_name == "SQL Symphony Concert")

```
In this step, I used Jeremy's clue to figure out who hired him. 


**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!


## And the final suspect is...

*Put the name of the person responsible for the murder here:* Miranda Priestly
